In this exercise, you will learn how the inspect element in browsers work
to help you improve your programming skills. The inspect element is a browser
tool that lets you view and edit the DOM and CSS of web content. Any edits
you will make will only appear on your personal screen, and last until you exit out.


There is a sample plain top page and try to experiment some of the panels in the inspect element tool.

When activating the inspect element window, you must right click from the browser and
select inspect element.

Let's learn each functions of the inspect element tool:

1. Element:
 You can see the DOM and CSS in the element functionality.
 Try to edit the background color of your header to any color you like.

 In element, you can also delete a div. Try deleting one.

2. Console:
 The console is for checking your javascript codes if there are any errors or warnings.

 In your editor, Try creating a button inside a div and add this one in your script file or script tag:
<script>
    document.addEventListener('click', function(event) {
        console.log("Success!");
    }, false);
</script>

the result of that "console.log" shows/displays in the console tab in the inspect element.

3. Sources
 The sources will show you the hierarchy of your files.
 Try to navigate each folder and files and compare it to your local files.

4. Network
 This allows you to inspect resources as they are accessed over the network.
 Try to browse any site you want and click inspect element. once the tool panel opens up,
 click to select Network, then press F5 on your keyboard to refresh the page. You will
 notice that the timeline will begin populating file names in a waterfall list of
 associated network activities.
